# Peafowl Calculator
Peafowl Calculator is a tool that helps determine the results of various peafowl breeding pairs, and helps to visualize what specific peafowl will look like

# Technical Specs

## JavaScript Version
- `index.html` - Main UI page
- `app.js` - Application logic and data definitions
- `genes.js` - List of all known genes, and how they convert to phenotypes
- `converters.js` - Genotype/phenotype conversion functions
- `children.js` - Calculates the children from the selected parents
- `content/Images/` - Peafowl images

## Adding new colors/genes
 - Download the repository to your computer
 - Add the image files into `/content/Images`, in the relevent subfolder (ie a new color morph for male birds would go under `/content/Images/Male/Color/{MorphName}.png`)
 - Go to genes.js and find an array with a name that sounds like the kind of gene you are adding (ie colors that are generated by sex-linked genes are named `sexLinkedColorAllotypes`)
 - Match the formatting, and add a new object (everything in the braces `{}`) to the array
 - Save the code changes, and open the index.html file in your brower
 - If you did it right, the new gene should show up!
 - Make a pull request with your changes
